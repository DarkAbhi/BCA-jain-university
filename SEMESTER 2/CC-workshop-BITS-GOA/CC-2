Step 1: Go to the azure portal and search the DNS option in networking part.
Step 2: Create a DNS zone
	Note-: The DNS zone name must be same as the existing domain name.
	After creating the DNS zone, azure will provide 4 name servers
Step 3: You have to replace all these 4 name servers to their existing name servers as in freenom.com

For connecting one domain to another domain, you can create a record set where the record type is called as CNAME.

There are different type of record types used in DNS
1.A record
2.AA record
3.AAAA record
4.txt record
5.MX record (Mail exchange)
6.CNAME (Canonical Name)
7.ptr (Pointer record)
